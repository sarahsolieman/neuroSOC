# ðŸ§  neuroSOC

**neuroSOC** is a prototype that reimagines the Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow by integrating **AI** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.  
It automatically summarizes incidents, correlates context from internal playbooks, and generates recommended next steps â€” reducing analyst triage time and surfacing institutional knowledge on demand.

---

## Overview

neuroSOC enhances SOC efficiency by using RAG to combine incident data with internal playbooks, enabling automated reasoning and decision support for analysts.

---

## Features

- **RAG-powered reasoning** â€“ LLM retrieves and reasons over relevant SOC playbooks.  
- **Automated incident summaries** â€“ Converts raw alerts into clear, structured insights.  
- **Knowledge transparency** â€“ Displays which sources informed each recommendation.  
- **Interactive UI** â€“ Streamlit app for quick demo and testing.

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- FAISS for vector search  
- OpenAI / AWS Bedrock for embeddings + LLM  
- Streamlit for UI  
- pandas / json for log parsing

## Example Prompt

**System:**  
You are an expert SOC analyst who summarizes and contextualizes security incidents.  
Be concise, technical, and actionable.

**User:**  
Here are raw logs and the top 3 relevant playbooks.

```
Logs:
{incident_logs}

Playbooks:
{retrieved_docs}
```

**Task:**  
1. Summarize the likely incident type.  
2. Identify affected assets or users.  
3. Recommend remediation and next steps.  
4. Include references to the playbooks used.


## Future Ideas

- Integrate real Splunk / SIEM APIs for live data  
- Add threat-intel enrichment (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB)  
- Deploy via AWS Step Functions + Lambda for full automation  
- Fine-tune smaller open models for on-prem SOCs

## Impact

Demonstrates how retrieval-augmented LLMs can enhance security operations by transforming noisy incident data into actionable intelligence â€” automating first-level triage and freeing analysts for higher-order reasoning.
