# ðŸ§  neuroSOC

**neuroSOC** is a prototype that reimagines the Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow by integrating **AI** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.  
It automatically summarizes incidents, correlates context from internal playbooks, and generates recommended next steps â€” reducing analyst triage time and surfacing institutional knowledge on demand.

[![Launch Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch%20Demo-00C6C2?style=for-the-badge&logo=streamlit&logoColor=white)](https://neurosoc.streamlit.app)

This hosted version runs **entirely in demo mode** â€” it showcases the workflow and interface without real API calls or external dependencies.  
For realistic results, clone the repo, disable demo mode, and add your own `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Demo-Only Mode

> **Note:** The deployed version of **neuroSOC** runs entirely in demo mode.  
> It always returns a **pre-generated summary** and **example response** to illustrate functionality.  
>  
> To run it in live, realistic mode, youâ€™d need to:
> 1. Disable demo mode (`DEMO_MODE=False`)  
> 2. Add a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your environment  
>  
> The demo exists purely to show the **end-to-end pipeline, UI, and reasoning flow** without requiring API usage.
