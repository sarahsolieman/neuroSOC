### Incident Summary

1. **Incident Type**
   - Unauthorized access attempt followed by successful login and potential malware execution.

2. **Root Cause**
   - Multiple failed login attempts from a single IP address (45.66.22.4) indicating a brute-force attack, followed by a successful login and execution of a potentially malicious file (`sysupdater.exe`).

3. **Affected Assets**
   - User account: `admin` (initially targeted with failed logins).
   - User account: `ops1` (successfully logged in).
   - Endpoint associated with `ops1` (where `sysupdater.exe` was executed).

4. **Recommended Response Actions**
   - Block the offending IP address (45.66.22.4) to prevent further access attempts.
   - Force a password reset for the `admin` and `ops1` accounts.
   - Isolate the endpoint where `sysupdater.exe` was executed from the network.
   - Delete the `sysupdater.exe` file and any associated malicious binaries.
   - Collect the hash of the malicious file and submit it to VirusTotal for analysis.
   - Review event logs for any new user creation or privilege escalation activities.
   - Monitor for lateral movement within the network.

5. **Which playbooks informed your reasoning**
   - **Authentication Anomalies Playbook**: For detecting multiple failed logins and a successful login following those failures.
   - **Malware Execution Playbook**: For identifying the execution of a suspicious process (`sysupdater.exe`) and network connections to an unknown IP.
   - **Privilege Escalation Playbook**: For monitoring potential privilege escalation activities following the successful login.
